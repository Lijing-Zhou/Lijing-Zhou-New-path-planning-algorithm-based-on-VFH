This is my bachloar project of 


Nowadays, the increasing numbers of mobile robots have
become common in our daily life. More and more people
realize the importance of the mobile robots in completing
complex tasks. Furthermore, engineers starts to focus on the
objects color and shape recognition and maneuvering in an
unknown environment. The objective of the task is to do
the correct navigation and find a suitable path plan to get
the destination when avoiding obstacles. The algorithm we
created is based on the VFH and it can give the precise
obstacle avoiding in the gazebo world environment and really
world. The VFH algorithm created histogram to divide the
part that the robot can run to guide the robot to the goal. We
use the similar theory to divide the parts based on the lidar.
The lidar is like a radar to launch the light and accept the
feedback to identity the obstacles and return the distance. The
different angle between the start point and the end point also
can influence the linear and angular speeds that we want to
give the robot
